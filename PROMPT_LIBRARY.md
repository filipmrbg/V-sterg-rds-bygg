## 🧱 BRICK 7: Customer Reviews Generator

Copy and paste the following into the AI chat:

```text
Use this brick to replace the existing reviews on the website.

Replace the current reviews by generating exactly 3 new customer reviews.
The new reviews should naturally fit the current company based on its name, location, and services. The system should determine what details are appropriate to include.

Each time this prompt is used:
- The existing reviews must be fully replaced.
- The new reviews must be original and tailored to the business.
- Reviewer names must be realistic and localized to the company's operating area.
- Wording and tone should vary naturally.
- Reviews should sound human, believable, and authentic (avoid generic marketing jargon).
- The three reviews should have slightly different lengths (varying character counts) while maintaining visually balanced cards.

The result must be placed directly into the website’s reviews/testimonials section, replacing old content entirely.
```

## 🧱 BRICK 8: Cleanup Unused Assets & Template Content

Copy and paste the following into the AI chat:

```text
Use this brick to clean up unused assets and leftover template content across the entire project.

Scan the entire codebase and identify any images, videos, logos, icons, or other media files that are no longer used anywhere in the website. Remove these unused assets completely from the project (e.g., from public/ or src/assets/).

Also search for and remove any leftover template content, placeholder text, demo images, unused components, or unused imports that are no longer referenced in the code.

Ensure that only assets currently used in the website remain in the project.
Do not remove any files that are actively referenced by the website.

The goal is to keep the project clean, lightweight, and free from unused template assets before final SEO and metadata checks are performed.
```

## 🧱 BRICK 9: SEO & Metadata Verification

Copy and paste the following into the AI chat:

```text
Ensure that the website displays correct and consistent company information everywhere, especially for SEO and social link previews.

Scan the entire project and identify all sources of metadata and structured data, including:
- <title> and meta description in index.html
- Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:site_name, og:url, og:image)
- Twitter Card tags
- JSON-LD (Organization / LocalBusiness schema)
- Manifests or config files that inject metadata

Remove all outdated, duplicated, or conflicting company information and ensure that only the current, correct company name and location are used consistently across all metadata.

Use the information provided in the previous bricks to populate all metadata fields and ensure consistency across the entire project.

Use absolute URLs where required, ensure all required meta tags are present, and confirm that SEO results and social link previews display the correct company information.
```
